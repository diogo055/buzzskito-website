  {
    question: 'Does Fairy Lake in Acton contribute to mosquito pressure?',
    answer: "Fairy Lake — the central water feature in Acton — is a warm, shallow reservoir with extensive marshy edges that sustain active mosquito breeding through the summer. Homes around Acton that are within a few blocks of the lake or the Black Creek system feeding it consistently experience heavy mosquito pressure from late May onward. The Acton Memorial Park and recreation areas around the lake add further shaded resting habitat. Properties near Fairy Lake benefit from an early May first treatment before peak emergence.",
  },
  {
    question: 'Why does Halton Hills have such high tick and mosquito risk compared to other GTA municipalities?',
    answer: "Halton Hills sits at the intersection of three ecological systems that independently drive pest pressure: the Credit River watershed, the Niagara Escarpment corridor, and the Silver Creek conservation area network. Each of these systems provides standing water, shaded forest habitat, and continuous movement of pest populations from natural areas into residential communities. The municipality has among the highest Conservation Halton land coverage of any GTA municipality, which means there are relatively few properties that are far from a natural pest source area.",
  },
  {
    question: 'What is the mosquito season length in Halton Hills?',
    answer: "Halton Hills homeowners near creek and river corridors typically deal with mosquitoes from the first week of May through mid to late September — a full five-month season. Properties in more urban parts of Georgetown and Acton may see a slightly shorter active period, from mid-May to early September. We recommend five seasonal treatments spaced 28 days apart, starting in the first two weeks of May, to maintain continuous coverage through the entire active season.",

          <h2>Why Mosquito Pressure Is High in Halton Hills</h2>
          <p>Halton Hills encompasses Georgetown and Acton as well as the surrounding rural townships of Esquesing and Ballinafad — a broad municipality where conservation lands make up a higher percentage of total area than almost any other in the GTA. The Credit River runs through Georgetown and south toward Milton, while Silver Creek and its conservation area network drain through the northern parts of the municipality. In Acton, Fairy Lake and Black Creek create a focal point of water-associated mosquito activity in the heart of the community.</p>
          <p>The Niagara Escarpment trail system runs along the western boundary of Halton Hills, and the network of pond and wetland features within Conservation Halton lands sustains mosquito populations that move freely into residential areas throughout the season. Properties on Halton Hills&apos; many rural roads and semi-rural residential streets face some of the highest sustained mosquito pressure in the western GTA — matched only by Caledon and the Credit River communities to the north.</p>

          <h2>Halton Hills Communities We Serve</h2>
          <p>BuzzSkito provides mosquito control across all Halton Hills communities, including:</p>
